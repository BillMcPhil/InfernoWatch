# InfernoWatch

InfernoWatch is a full stack web app that was made for the GDSC Mac-a-thon at McMaster University. It consists of a Convolutional Neural Network that judges whether or not an area has been affected by wildfires based on satellite imagery. Users input location information on the front end and then satellite images are pulled from Google Maps and fed into the CNN to determine a percentage of area that has been burned.
